# GraphRAG for Patient Background Briefing in Echocardiography

This repository provides a novel **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline enhanced by a **domain-specific knowledge graph**, referred to as **GraphRAG**. It is designed to generate concise and accurate patient background briefings to support **echocardiography** workflows.

## Overview

In echocardiography, clinicians often need a reliable summary of a patient’s medical history, prior imaging, and indications for a new study. Traditional RAG approaches rely primarily on vector-based retrieval, which can struggle with complex medical reasoning and the need for highly accurate clinical information. 

**GraphRAG** addresses these challenges by:

1. **Combining Semantic and Graph-Based Retrieval**  
   - Uses dense vector embeddings for semantic matches **and** traverses a structured knowledge graph to surface authoritative cardiology data.  
2. **Reducing Hallucinations**  
   - Grounds the model’s output in **domain-specific** relationships and definitions, minimizing potentially harmful misinformation.  
3. **Enhancing Clinical Utility**  
   - Generates more complete, coherent, and accurate **patient briefings** than conventional zero-shot approaches.

For more details on the underlying methods, results, and discussion, please refer to the **[final report]** included in this repository.

## Key Features

- **Domain-Specific Knowledge Graph**  
  A graph of more than 600 nodes and 500+ edges derived from **authoritative cardiology sources**, capturing protocols for cardiomyopathies, heart transplants, ventricular assist devices, etc.
  
- **Hybrid Retrieval**  
  1. **Vector Search** (semantic embeddings) for broad retrieval.  
  2. **Graph Traversal** for structured medical reasoning and relationship exploration.  

- **Clinical Evaluation**  
  Human expert evaluations show **improved coherence**, **factual consistency**, and **completeness**, with fewer harmful statements compared to a zero-shot baseline.  

- **Extensible Pipeline**  
  Can be adapted for other **high-stakes domains** that require minimal hallucination and factual correctness (e.g., radiology, oncology, or other specialized medical areas).


## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/GraphRAG-Echocardiography.git
   cd GraphRAG-Echocardiography
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**  
   If you use Conda (example below), install dependencies from `environment.yml`:  
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate graphrag-env
   ```

3. **Install Additional Requirements** (if any)  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Below is a simplified workflow to generate patient background briefings:

1. **Data Parsing**  
   - Place raw PDF or text-based discharge notes under `data/raw/`.  
   - Run the parsing script (e.g., `parse_documents.py`) to convert them into plain text or structured text:
     ```bash
     python src/ingestion/parse_documents.py --input data/raw --output data/parsed
     ```

2. **Embedding Generation**  
   - Convert the parsed text into high-dimensional vector embeddings:
     ```bash
     python src/embeddings/generate_embeddings.py --input data/parsed --output data/embeddings
     ```

3. **Graph Construction**  
   - Build or update the domain-specific knowledge graph:
     ```bash
     python src/graph/knowledge_graph/build_graph.py --input data/parsed
     ```
   - This populates a **Memgraph** or **Neo4j** instance with nodes and edges capturing crucial relationships in echocardiography (protocols, devices, conditions, etc.).

4. **Hybrid Retrieval and Generation**  
   - Run the GraphRAG pipeline:
     ```bash
     python src/generation/run_graphrag.py \
        --notes data/parsed/sample_discharge_note.txt \
        --embeddings data/embeddings \
        --graph-config graph/knowledge_graph/config.yml
     ```
   - The system will:
     1. Perform **vector-based** retrieval to find relevant context from your embeddings.  
     2. Traverse the **knowledge graph** for additional, highly relevant medical facts.  
     3. Feed both contexts into a language model (e.g., GPT-4) to generate a focused and factually consistent **patient briefing**.

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Use the provided human or automated evaluation scripts in `src/evaluation/` to assess coherence, factual consistency, and comprehensiveness of generated briefings.
