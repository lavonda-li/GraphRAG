# EIMS Data

Procedure Components: 2-D, Color Flow, Doppler +/- Strain Imaging, Amyl Nitrite, IV Contrast Agent

Serial Study: General, HOCM

Findings: Comment if obstructive/non-obstructive, thickest segment & measurement, septal contour

AI: Select ‘Run HCM’ report

Billing Diagnosis: Cardiomyopathy Hypertrophic; if no findings bill for symptoms, etc.

# Procedure

(TTE) 2D Echo Doppler Color +/- Contrast

# Charge capture

+/- Myocardial Strain – Hospital

# Obtain the following if the last echo was:

≥ 2 years → full echo + following

< 2 years → LV Function Protocol + following

|2D|CFI|Doppler|Measurement| | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Parasternal| |LV wall thickness (LAX, SAX)|MR jet direction (LAX)|CW - MR velocity|LV max wall thickness| |
|Apical| |SAM|†LV obstruction|CW - MR velocity|LV max wall thickness| |

|Apical w/ Valsalva, Squat to stand, and/or Amyl Nitrite (if < 50 mmHg)| |SAM|LV obstruction|CW - MR velocity| | |
| | |MR|CW - LV Obstruction| | | |

# Caveats and Tips

• LV max wall thickness: any segment in any view. Contrast can improve endocardial border definition.

• †CFI for LV Obstruction: use full length CFI box (LV apex to full LA) to assess LV obstruction & MR; consider color M-mode for obstruction assessment.

• * LVOT MIG: If resting gradient is <50 mmHg proceed with Valsalva, if the Valsalva gradient is <50 mmHg proceed with squat-to-stand (S2S), if S2S is not possible or gradient is <50 mmHg, consider Amyl.

• Apical HCM pouch: try off-axis views. Contrast is recommended.

• Evaluate for aberrant muscle bundles or abnormal papillary muscles.

• LV strain not required for Mayo confirmed HCM patients that had prior echo with strain. Do LV strain for:

- ✓ HCM patient having first Mayo echo
- ✓ Echo ordered for HCM screening or positive family history of HCM
- ✓ Echo suggestive of HCM but not yet diagnosed
- ✓ Echo suggests athletes heart vs. HCM

# PROTOCOL: PACEMAKER AV OPTIMIZATION

# Inclusion Criteria

- Complete study has been performed within the current clinical episode
- Referral is pacemaker optimization
- Patient has operational atrial lead and one or more ventricular leads
- Pacemaker nurse is available (call 4-8600 or 4-8539)

# EIMS Data

Procedure Components: 2D-Limited, Doppler Limited (unless a complete study is also performed)

Referral Diagnoses: Biventricular pacemaker A-V optimization

Serial Study: None (unless complete study performed)

First Impression: Echocardiogram performed during pacemaker optimization.

# Findings:

1. Optimal A-V delay =
2. Optimal V-V offset =
3. Unable to optimize A-V delay (if applicable)

Billing Diagnosis: Pacemaker Cardiac Status Post (also: echo findings, symptoms, physical exam, etc.)

Procedure: (TTE) 2D Limited with Limited Doppler

if complete echo also performed (TTE) 2D Echo Doppler Color

# Caveats

- Pacemaker optimization studies require a high degree of cooperation between Echo Lab consultants, device nursing staff, sonographers, and desk personnel. Pacemaker optimization may not be performed without the input of a consultant
- A device nurse is held on standby - notify the pacemaker department immediately if the pacemaker device optimization portion is deemed unnecessary
- It is preferred that V-V optimization be performed before A-V optimization

# Obtain the following:

|Doppler|Measurement|
|---|---|
|Parasternal|LVOT diameter|
|Apical| |
|PW - Mitral inflow|Visually assess degree of E/A fusion|
|CW - AV TVI|AV TVI / velocity|

# V-V Optimization

Aim: Find the V-V interval (LV-RV offset) that gives the largest LV stroke volume.

1. Obtain CW Doppler through aortic valve at multiple V-V intervals roughly 20-30 ms apart, measure the TVI, and calculate SV. Start at a V-V delay of 0(12).

# Caveats and Tips

- Do not over gain CW Doppler signals (as this leads to an overestimated SV)
- PW LVOT Doppler signals can also be used but can be technically difficult to reproduce (for this reason CW Doppler is preferred)

|First Chamber|V-V Delay|AV Delay|Adjusted AV Delay|LVOT TVI|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|LV first|80|AV delay| | |
|LV first|60|AV delay| | |
|LV first|40|AV delay| | |
|LV first|20|AV delay| | |
|LV first (Start Here)|0 (12)|AV delay| | |
|RV first|-20*|AV delay – VV offset (20)| | |
|RV first|-40*|AV delay – VV offset (40)| | |
|RV first|-60*|AV delay – VV offset (60)| | |
|RV first|-80*|AV delay – VV offset (80)| | |

*Decrease the AV interval by this amount when the RV is stimulated first to maintain an unchanged interval of contraction between LA and LV.

# A-V Optimization

Aim: Find the A-V interval which maximizes the amplitude and duration of mitral inflow “A” wave.

1. Assess pulsed wave Doppler of mitral inflow at multiple A-V intervals roughly 20-30 ms apart (e.g. 80 ms to 200 ms). Caution: Do not prolong the A-V interval so long as to lose biventricular stimulation in CRT patients.

|A-V interval (msec)|Comments|
|---|---|
|80| |
|100| |
|120| |
|140| |
|160| |
|180| |
|200| |

# TEE prior to (as part of the evaluation for) LAA closure (e.g. WATCHMAN device)

The specific goals of the TEE performed as part of the pre-Watchman evaluation include:

- Obtaining LAA measurements to confirm anatomy conducive for Watchman device implantation and to determine the device size
- Exclude

# LAA anatomy

Left atrial appendage anatomy: divided into 3 parts.

1. The ostium is typically oval and diameters range from 10-40 mm, is well characterized by 3D imaging and is separated from the left upper pulmonary vein by the posterolateral ridge.
2. The neck of the LAA is the tubular junction between the ostium and lobar portions, neighbors the circumflex and LAD coronaries and the sinus node artery in one third.
3. The lobar region is the largest and most variable portion. Two or more lobes are found in >50%.

# LAA images

Obtain 2D images of the LAA at decreased depth or zoom to optimize LAA assessment. Views should be obtained at 0, 45, 90 and 135 degrees.

Obtain the maximal measurements of the ostium diameter, width & length of the primary LAA lobe at end ventricular systole. (ostium typically largest at 120-135 degrees)

At 0 degrees, a measurement in the plane from left coronary artery to a point approximately 1-2 cm from the tip of the postero-lateral ridge. (see diagram to the right).

# Tips for obtaining LAA images at 0 degrees:

- Begin in mid-esophageal view; withdraw the probe until just above the mitral valve; counter clock slightly; flex slightly; adjust the depth of the probe until the LAA is visualized; Adjust the “right-left” wheel to optimize the image.

At 45, 90, 135 degrees appropriate 2D views such that a measurement in the plane from the top of the MV annulus to a point approximately 2 cm from the tip of the postero-lateral ridge is possible. (See diagrams below)

|1-2cm|1-2cm|1-2cm|
|---|---|---|
|LAA width and height at 45⁰|LAA width and height at 90⁰|LAA width and height at 135⁰|

# TEE prior to LAA closure (e.g. WATCHMAN device)

Images to be obtained: (measures of the LAA should be performed when LAA size is largest at end ventricular systole)

- 2D 4 chamber, 2 chamber and 3 chamber views optimizing the LV
- Multiple 2D imaging planes of the LA
- Multiple 2D imaging planes of LAA device at decreased depth or zoom mode (at a minimum record views at 0°, 45°, 90° and 135°) – as described above.
- Color Doppler of the LAA at decreased depth or zoom mode, at best angle visualized.
- Reduce the Nyquist limit to optimize color flow (include the full width of the LAA ostium surrounding the borders and tip of LAA).
- Pulsed wave Doppler within the LAA (sampled volume at least 1cm into the LAA);
- 3D of the LAA ostium with diameter and area measures. Off-line measures performed in Q-lab with a similar measurement approach to the LVOT diameter measures.
- 2D Mitral Valve w/w’out color in multiple images planes (include views such as 4ch, 3ch and 2ch)
- CW Doppler through the mitral valve for MS
- 2D and color Doppler of Interatrial Septum at 45°, 90° and 135°. If atrial septal aneurysm is present: measure the atrial septal total excursion and the ASA length
- 2D of agitated saline passage to assess for intraatrial shunt
- 2D imaging from the esophagus and / or stomach to assess for pericardial effusion
- 2D of Ascending Aorta, Aortic Arch and Descending Aorta

Use of echo contrast with low MI imaging (0.1-0.3) should be considered, as appropriate, to differentiate pectinate muscle from thrombus.

# LAA Occluder Device Requirements (5 device sizes: 21, 24, 27, 30 and 33 mm)

- Landing zone should be measured from the inferior part of the LAA ostium at the level of the circumflex coronary artery to a point 1-2 cm distal to the tip of the posterolateral ridge.
- Required landing zone diameters: 17-31 mm.
- Choice of device size: 2-4 mm larger than the largest measured diameter.
- Required depth of main anchoring lobe: needs to be ≥ the maximum LAA ostium size to be able to implant any given size device.

|Other Windows (Subcostal, SSN, RSC)| | | | |
|IVC|Color m-mode - HV|PW - HV| | |
| | |PW - SVC| | |

# Caveats and Tips

- Follow-up exams: Use LV Function Protocol, add LV lateral TDI, strain, and the above images
- Respirometer: Quality tracings are critical (see Respirometer Tips document)
- HV & SVC tips: ↓ color scale, ↑ SV size (5 to 7 mm), insure SV stays within flow
- Tissue Doppler: Velocities may vary so measure the highest (respirometer not needed)
- Pericardiectomy: Perform strain to evaluate for resolution of regional strain abnormalities
- Strain: Constrictive pericarditis shows a specific strain pattern of regional changes (↓ in lateral walls [LV and RV], preserved or ↑ septal wall)

# Strain

Constrictive pericarditis shows a specific strain pattern of regional changes:

|Constriction:|Restriction:|
|---|---|
|RV free wall strain &lt; LV septal strain|RV free wall strain &gt; LV septal strain|
|LV free wall strain &lt; LV septal strain|LV free wall strain ≥ LV septal strain|

If strain can’t be performed on all segments partial analysis can still help determine regional variation (e.g. 4C and RV views may distinguish septal from free wall strain)

# PROTOCOL: LEFT VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE

Omit the following:

- LA strain/volumes, LV volumes, pulmonary veins, LVOT TVI (unless aortic valve opening), AV TVI, all TDI, abdominal aorta

# Tips

If pump speed is to be changed during the echo, an echo consultant AND a provider from the VAD team (NP, PA, MD) must be present.

No data is better than wrong (phantom) data.

# Note:

- most recent chest x-ray, chest CT, and echo images (especially cannula flow and window, caval window, apical images) and report (for aberrant velocities)
- anatomic placement details (e.g. where does the outflow cannula insert)
- device type and pump speed in the report (ask the patient)

# Outflow cannula:

- Systolic velocities should be higher than diastolic velocities
- Flow should be away from the transducer (below the baseline)
- Try RPS, high RPS, high LPS windows (assess SSN and RSC if not seen elsewhere)
- CW Doppler is preferred for the outflow cannula primarily to acquire the highest gradient and to more easily note the presence of obstruction (kinks in the cannula, etc.). Report the CW Doppler velocity in EIMS.

# Inflow cannula:

- Systolic velocities should be higher than diastolic velocities
- PW Doppler is preferred for the inflow cannula primarily to avoid the mitral inflow which is a common contaminant.
- Avoid signals where the mitral inflow contaminates the inflow cannula flow.

# The HeartMate 3 artificial pulse algorithm

causes periodic rapid changes in pump speed and is responsible for temporarily higher cannula flow peak velocities.

# Color:

- Adjust color scale to help place pulsed wave sample volume
- Decrease color gain to minimize color artifact

# Caveats

- If color flow Doppler demonstrates worsening regurgitation by ≥ two grades, perform a comprehensive regurgitation assessment
- Obtain RVOT diameter and TVI only if calculation of total cardiac output is desired. The total cardiac output (combined LVAD flow output and native LVOT flow output [if any]) is equal to the RVOT cardiac output.

# Echocardiographic Considerations for Patients with WiSEᵀᴹ CRT Device

As part of SOLVE-CRT, patients undergo implantation of the WiSEᵀᴹ CRT System. The WiSEᵀᴹ CRT System is an implantable cardiac pacing system that provides biventricular pacing. This includes LV endocardial stimulation via an electrode that converts ultrasound energy into electrical energy for pacing. The wireless electrode is activated by an implanted ultrasound transmitter for its normal operation, but in rare instances (reportedly 3% of implants) transthoracic echo imaging has triggered extra stimulations. Extra stimulations have usually been associated with apical or near-apical electrode implants.

It is anticipated that patients will undergo planned or unplanned echocardiographic imaging in the outpatient and inpatient setting. The purpose of this document is to understand risk factors for extra stimulations, facilitate identification of extra stimulations during echo imaging, and outline an echo imaging protocol to minimize the risk of extra stimulations should they occur.

# Risk Factors for Extra Stimulations:

- Apical or near apical electrode position
- Short time interval after electrode implant
- Imaging from apical views (resulting in the echo probe in very close proximity to the electrode)
- High Power Settings (as indicated in displayed Mechanical Index)
- Low Frequency ultrasound (often used for harmonic imaging)
- Thin body habitus

# Safety Considerations for Patients with WiSEᵀᴹ-CRT Device Undergoing Echocardiography

1. If the patient has previously had noted echo-induced ventricular arrythmia: utilize the low power (low MI) echo imaging protocol (see below).
2. Identify the location of the LV endocardial implant (apical, mid, or basal ventricle). If an apical electrode is discovered, stop imaging and commence the low power (low MI) echo imaging protocol (see below) to reduce the risk of extra stimulations.
3. If new premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are observed in what was previously a stable background ECG, this may represent echo-induced extra stimulations. If this occurs, stop imaging and commence the low power (low MI) echo imaging protocol (see below).
4. Use of CW Doppler should be minimized and do not directly focus the CW ultrasound beam on the electrode. Know the location of the LV endocardial implant prior to any use of CW Doppler.

# Low Power (Low MI) Echocardiographic Protocol for WiSEᵀᴹ-CRT

Outlined below are the recommended echo procedural steps for those with an apical LV electrode implant, those with new PVCs that occur during echocardiographic imaging, or those with a history of extra stimulations on prior echocardiograms.

1. Reduce power (MI) setting to the lowest possible machine setting.
2. Increase machine power incrementally until image quality is adequate. STOP imaging and proceed to step 3 if extra stimulation is observed and image quality remains inadequate.
3. If extra stimulations occur prior to achieving adequate image quality, consider the use of an ultrasound enhancement agent with the lowest MI settings.

# CVSURGER STRUCIURAL WNTERVENTION

# URGERY TRUCTURAL NTERVENTION

# Inclusion Criteria

- Dismissal echo requests from CV in patients who are status post cardiac surgery
- Does NOT include non-dismissal study types (example: rule out effusion).
- When uncertain if echo is for dismissal, please consult the ACS or interpreting physician

# EIMS Data

# Procedure Components:

2-D, Color Flow Doppler, Doppler

# Coded Referral Diagnosis:

Surgical procedure type

# Serial Study:

General. Stop/remove serial studies that no longer apply (ex: AS studies in AVR patients)

# First Finding:

Echocardiogram performed per dismissal echo protocol.

# Second Finding:

Status post… (surgery type, usually found in the post-operative history folder)

# Billing Diagnosis:

Variable (echo findings, surgery/intervention type, symptoms, physical exam, etc.)

# Procedure:

(TTE) 2D Echo Doppler Color

# Obtain LV Function Protocol + the following:

- AVR/Clinical TAVR = All views of AR, AV gradient from all windows, ascending aorta & arch
- Device closure for periprosthetic AR = All views of AR, AV gradient-all windows, ascending aorta & arch
- Device closure for periprosthetic MR = All views for MR, zoom SAX of MV, MV gradient, atrial septum
- Open MV repair/replace = All views for MR, zoom parasternal SAX of MV, MV gradient, LV outflow gradient if SAM (do not Valsalva), ascending aorta & arch
- Mitral Edge-to-Edge = All views for MR, zoom parasternal SAX of MV, MV gradient, atrial septum

- LV tissue Doppler can be excluded (still do mitral inflow)
- Visualize the ascending aorta and arch to assess for dissection
- Valve replacements/repair acquire 2D zoomed views in all windows
- Comment on LA and RA size (visual estimate only)
- Most patients can be rolled onto their left side; ask nurse if you have questions or need assistance

- Referral for screening of carcinoid heart disease

# EIMS Data

Procedure Components: 2-D Ext, Dop Ext, CFI, TDI, M-Mode, (possible 3D, IV Ag. Saline)

Serial Study: General, Pulm. HTN

First Impression: Echocardiogram performed per carcinoid protocol.

Billing Diagnosis: Carcinoid (select appropriate)

Procedure: (TTE) 2D Echo Doppler Color (possible contrast)

# Obtain:

# Caveats and Tips

- *If an agitated saline bubble study has been previously performed there is NO need to repeat
- Careful imaging of the PV including 2D and CW Doppler (for PS and PR) in multiple planes is essential. This should be performed in both the conventional parasternal short axis view as well as in a high parasternal long axis view (RV outflow view)
- Zoomed 2D images of all valves should be performed in all views to allow complete evaluation of valvular thickening and leaflet motion
- **3D RV volumes and EF should be performed if appropriate equipment and staff are available

# Follow-up TEE after WATCHMAN device deployment

The goal of the Follow up TEE examinations for patients with a WATCHMAN device is to assess for the following information:

- Absence / presence of residual LAA flow around the device. Use of echo contrast should be considered, as appropriate, to differentiate LAA flow from LUPV pericardial oblique sinus, and to differentiate pectinate muscle from thrombus.
- Absence / presence of residual atrial septal shunt.
- Device position confirmation.
- Absence / presence of thrombus on the WATCHMAN device.

Images of the LAA should be optimized at either a decreased depth or in zoom mode.

LAA seal is defined as no or a small amount of visible residual blood flow AROUND the margins of the device in a retrograde or antegrade fashion, with jet size &lt; 5mm. If there is residual LAA blood flow with a jet size &gt; 5mm AROUND the margins of device in either a retrograde or antegrade fashion, the device is not considered 'sealed'.

Device Seal: Perform color Doppler assessment by interrogating the entire device /LAA border. Perform a slow sweep from 0° to 180° to fully visualize the placement of the device while performing color Doppler. Include stops at approximately 0°, 45°, 90° and 135° to record clips. Check for residual flow around the device borders. Injection of Echo contrast (with low MI imaging (0.1 – 0.3)) may aid in assessing flow around the device. If a leak is visualized, the width of the leak should be measured at the plane of the device at the vena contracta and should exclude any color bleed over the device and/or myocardial structures.

G. Kane 10/12/2015

# Follow-up TEE after WATCHMAN device deployment

Images to be obtained:

- 2D 4 chamber, 2 chamber and 3 chamber views optimizing the LV
- Multiple 2D imaging planes of the LA
- Multiple 2D imaging planes of LAA device at decreased depth or zoom mode to optimize LAA device placement (at a minimum record views at 0°, 45°, 90° and 135°).
- Color Doppler of device at decreased depth or zoom mode, reduce the Nyquist limit to optimize color flow (include the full width of the LAA ostium surrounding the borders and tip of the appendage) (at a minimum record views at 0°, 45°, 90° and 135°).
- Repeat color Doppler interrogation around the device borders to include the entire device/LAA border. Perform a slow sweep from 0° to 180° to fully visualize placement of the device while performing color Doppler.
- Color Doppler of Interatrial Septum (residual shunt from trans-septal)
- 2D Mitral Valve in multiple images planes (include views such as 4ch, 3ch and 2ch) with and without color
- 2D imaging from the esophagus and/or stomach to assess for pericardial effusion
- 2D of Ascending Aorta, Aortic Arch and Descending Aorta

Use of echo contrast with low MI imaging (0.1 – 0.3) should be considered, as appropriate, to differentiate LAA flow from LUPV pericardial oblique sinus, and to differentiate pectinate muscle from thrombus.

Tips for obtaining LAA images at 0 degrees: Begin in mid-esophageal view; withdraw the probe until just above the mitral valve; counter clock slightly; flex slightly; adjust the depth of the probe until the LAA is visualized; Adjust the “right-left” wheel to optimize the image.

# Mayo Clinic Echocardiography Laboratory

# Congenital Transesophageal Echocardiography Protocol

# Rochester, MN 55905

# A. PRINCIPLE/PURPOSE

The majority of congenital transesophageal echocardiograms are intra-operative transesophageal
echocardiograms, which are performed in the St. Mary’s Hospital (SMH) Operating Rooms. SMH in-
patient transesophageal echocardiograms are performed in the echocardiography laboratory located on
4ᵗʰ Joseph. In addition, transesophageal echocardiograms may be performed bedside or in the cardiac
catheterization laboratory. Outpatient transesophageal echocardiograms are performed in the Gonda 6
Echocardiography Laboratory. The following information will pertain in general to the indications,
procedures and guidelines for congenital intra-operative transesophageal echocardiography.

# B. INDICATIONS (including, but not limited to)

Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography

- Pre and post-operative assessment of surgical repair of congenital heart disease
- Valve repair
- Valve replacement
- Myectomy for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- Unstable hemodynamics

Routine transesophageal echocardiography (inpatient or outpatient)

- Valve assessment, native and mechanical
- Technically difficult transthoracic echo
- Congenital abnormality (including shunt assessment in adults)
- Catheter closure procedure in patients with patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect
- Pre-cardioversion in patients with congenital heart disease

# C. CONTRAINDICATIONS

- History of esophageal disease such as stricture, ulcer, esophageal cancer, previous esophageal surgery.
- These are relative contraindications. If there is a question whether a patient truly has disease of
the esophagus, an upper endoscopy may be required prior to the transesophageal echocardiogram.
- Patient size

# D. MEDICATIONS

- Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiograms are routinely performed after induction of general
anesthesia, which is managed by the anesthesia team.
- Routine Congenital TEE
- Topical anesthetic with 1 inch 5% lidocaine paste and/or viscous lidocaine (2%) gargle
- Oxygen via nasal cannula prn

---

# Procedure # 2103

# Congenital Transesophageal Echocardiography Protocol

- IV Fentanyl®; usual dose 25-50 mg
- Versed® (midazolam); usual dose 2-10 mg
- If desired, Robinul® (glycopyrrolate); usual dose 0.2 mg
- If needed, Romazicon® (flumazenil); usual dose 0.2 mg
- If needed, Narcan® (naloxone HCL); usual dose 0.4 – 2 mg
- Occasionally general anesthesia with Propofol is used under the supervision of an Anesthesiologist (cath lab or ICU)
- Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiograms are routinely performed after induction of general anesthesia, which is managed by the anesthesia team.

# E. PATIENT EDUCATION (ROUTINE TEE)

- A nursing assessment and procedure-specific education will be performed as per the TEE procedural guideline. Both oral and written information is given to the patient.
- All patients or family give informed consent regarding the transesophageal echocardiogram procedure. The goals, risks and alternatives are discussed with the patient. In situations where informed consent is not able to be obtained (sedated patients on ventilators or other critically ill patients), either the referring physician or the physician performing the procedure obtains informed consent from the nearest family member or designated guardian.

# F. PROTOCOLS

# Intra-operative Transesophageal Echocardiogram

- After administration of general anesthesia, the anesthesiologist in charge of the case inserts the probe to the mid-esophagus.
- The intra-operative TEE is performed and interpreted by a pediatric cardiologist.
- Pre-bypass TEE images are obtained as outlined below, and discussed with the operative team.
- The standard views obtained (in any order) include:

---

# Procedure # 2103

# Congenital Transesophageal Echocardiography Protocol

- A limited, goal-directed study may be performed at the discretion of the referring physician or the physician performing the procedure, particularly if the patient has had a recent TTE or TEE.
- The probe is left in place during the operative procedure.
- Post-bypass images are obtained after the operative procedure is complete. In most cases, a complete two-dimensional, Color Flow and Doppler exam is performed to assess cardiac function and the cardiac repair. The findings are discussed with the operative team.
- Following the completion of the surgery, stabilization of the patient and closure of the chest, the TEE probe is removed.

# Routine Transesophageal Echocardiogram

- All patients are NPO as per the Mayo Clinic Moderate Sedation Guidelines. In general this means no solid meal eight hours prior to the procedure. Clear liquids or a light liquid meal may lessen the amount of time required to be NPO, but this is up to the discretion of the physician performing the procedure and the urgency of the transesophageal echocardiogram. Patients who are receiving tube feedings should be held NPO at least four hours prior to the procedure, depending on the location of the tube (pre- or post-pyloric).
- Confirmation of NPO status and any allergies are discussed.
- An intravenous line is started.
- Automated blood pressure measurement is obtained at baseline, every five to fifteen minutes, and p.r.n. during the procedure.
- Continuous oxygen saturation monitoring is performed.
- The physician performing the procedure reviews with the patient the goals, risks and alternatives of the procedure.
- Topical anesthesia of the oral pharynx is administered by giving viscous lidocaine gargle.
- For sedation, the patient typically receives Fentanyl® and/or Versed® in the doses outlined above. Mayo Moderate Sedation Guidelines are followed.
- The esophageal probe is lubricated with a combination of viscus lidocaine and lubricant.
- Esophageal intubation is performed.
- After protocol images are obtained, the TEE probe is withdrawn. Post-procedure care is administered as noted in the TEE procedural guideline.

---

# Current Page Content

- Methylene Blue 1% solution 1 mg/kg IV once over 5 minutes for treatment of methemoglobinemia.
- Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiograms are routinely performed after induction of general anesthesia, which is managed by the anesthesia team.

# Pre-Procedure

- Pre-procedure assessment must be performed according to the Mayo Clinic Adult Moderate Sedation Procedure.
- Venous access should be obtained prior to intravenous (IV) sedation and maintained during sedation until discharge criteria are met.
- Topical anesthesia of the oral pharynx may be administered by giving lidocaine paste or topical solution, viscous lidocaine gargle, or anesthetic spray.
- A final verification process must be completed prior to the start of the procedure. Verify the patient's identity using 2 identifiers.

# Intra-Procedure

- An airway assessment must be performed prior to administration of initial sedation medications and documented in the medical record.
- Immediate pre-sedation reassessment must be completed within 10 minutes preceding administration of initial sedation medications. This should include:
- Measurement of blood pressure
- Heart rate
- Oxygen saturation
- ECG monitoring
- CO2 monitoring when available or with deep sedation
- Refer to Mayo Clinic Moderate Sedation Drugs and Dosing for medication dosages and rates of administration. General principles which apply to all medication administration:
- Give medication in small incremental doses to desired effect.
- Assess therapeutic effect before determining the next incremental dose and observe patient for:
- A decrease in oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry
- Ability to ventilate and maintain a patent airway
- An appropriate response to physical stimulation and/or verbal command
- The patient must be continually monitored by direct observation and by indirect physiologic measurements.
- Oxygen saturation should be monitored by continuous pulse oximetry.
- Heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure should be monitored and documented at 5 min intervals during procedure.
- Airway patency and ventilatory status should be continually assessed by verifying air movement with breathing.
- Continuous ECG monitoring should be used on all patients who are receiving moderate or deep sedation. Document

---

# Initial Heart Rhythm and Significant Changes

- Level of consciousness (RASS) and pain assessment should be monitored as appropriate for sedation medication administration and/or procedure. Minimum documentation of every 15-20 minutes.
- Supplemental oxygen should be used for patients undergoing moderate and deep sedation unless medically contraindicated, or if it would place the patient at risk of fire when electrocautery or other ignition sources are used.
- The esophageal probe is lubricated.
- Esophageal intubation is performed.
- Images are obtained as listed below.

# Standard Views/Guidelines

The images do not need to be obtained in the order listed below. The examination should be performed in a methodical fashion although the order of imaging plane acquisitions and Doppler may vary so as to answer the question at hand in an expeditious fashion. It is also recognized that imaging characteristics of individual patients may preclude certain views and measurements. If 3D echocardiography or an echo enhancement agent is indicated, appropriate documentation must be included in the report. If any required view or Doppler signal cannot be adequately obtained, it should be recorded and labeled in order to demonstrate that it was attempted. A limited, goal-directed study may be performed at the discretion of the referring physician or the physician performing the procedure, particularly if the patient has had a recent TTE or TEE.

The standard views obtained (in any order) include:

- Gastric short axis and long axis views
- Standard 2 and 4 chamber views
- Short and long axis views of the aortic valve with appropriate Doppler
- Multiple imaging planes of the mitral valve with appropriate Doppler
- Multiple imaging planes of the tricuspid valve with appropriate Doppler
- Longitudinal view of the pulmonic valve with appropriate Doppler
- Multiple imaging planes of the right atrium, left atrium and left atrial appendage with appropriate Doppler
- In cases of suspected cardiac source of emboli, when no obvious intracardiac shunt is identified with color Doppler, injection of agitated saline is required unless contraindicated.

---

# Imaging Procedures

- Multiple imaging planes of the atrial septum and foramen ovale with appropriate Doppler
- Imaging of the pulmonary veins with appropriate Doppler (when mitral regurgitation is present)
- Multiple imaging planes of the ascending, descending and transverse arch of the aorta
- Long axis views of the main pulmonary artery and proximal portions of the right and left pulmonary arteries
- Images of the proximal inferior and superior vena cava
- Imaging of the pericardial space and pericardium

# Post-Procedure

- After all images are obtained, the TEE probe is withdrawn.
- Document a post-procedural note after the procedure. Specific procedural information (echo findings), pertinent sedation information, and/or patient dismissal instructions must be documented.
- Assess the patient’s status post-procedure
- Vital signs
- Oxygen Saturation
- Level of consciousness (RASS)
- Pain Assessment
- Mayo Modified Discharge Score
- Assess and document discharge criteria (see Mayo Modified Discharge Scoring tool):
- Cardiovascular function and airway patency are stable relative to the pre-procedure status.
- The patient is easily arousable and protective reflexes are intact.
- If the patient has met discharge criteria but is being transferred to an inpatient unit, notice from the post-sedation area to the next care area should occur.
- If reversal agents are administered (e.g. naloxone, flumazenil, etc.), observation should continue until discharge criteria are clearly met and the potential for patient re-sedation has passed.
- Dismissal
- Observe patients who received moderate sedation until post sedation discharge criteria are met using the Mayo Modified Discharge Scoring tool and document in the medical record.
- Discharge patients who have received moderate sedation from the area in the company of a responsible adult.
- Discharged patients should be accompanied by a responsible adult.

# Adult Comprehensive Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) Protocol

# Content Applies To:

All Mayo Clinic Echocardiography Laboratories

# Scope

This protocol is to be used as a guideline for Echo Lab Staff performing TTE procedures in all Mayo Clinic Echocardiography Laboratories.

# Purpose

This protocol is intended to provide the minimum components of a standard transthoracic echocardiogram. Practice guidelines for complete and/or focused exams for specific referral diagnoses or findings may be found on the Mayo Clinic Echo Lab web page.

# Protocol

# Indications

# Standard Views/Guidelines

The images do not need to be obtained in the order listed below. The examination should be performed in a methodical fashion although the order of imaging plane acquisitions and Doppler may vary so as to answer the question at hand in an expeditious fashion. It is also recognized that imaging characteristics of individual patients may preclude certain views and measurements.

Contrast is indicated for use when two or more segments cannot be visualized adequately for the assessment of LV function (LVEF and regional wall motion assessment) and/or in settings in which the study indication requires accurate analysis of regional wall motion. If a contrast agent cannot be used for technical reasons or if contrast is contraindicated, the report must include a comment suggesting alternative imaging.

# Standard 2D Views

1. Parasternal long axis view
2. Parasternal short axis views (at the level of the aortic valve, left ventricle at the basal, mid and apical levels)
3. Ascending aorta view
4. Right ventricular inflow view
5. Right ventricular outflow view
6. Apical four-chamber view
7. Apical two-chamber view
8. Apical five-chamber view
9. Apical long axis view
10. Dedicated apical right ventricular view
11. Subcostal four chamber view
12. Subcostal short axis view (when indicated)
13. Subcostal IVC/hepatic vein view
14. Long and/or short-axis views of the abdominal aorta to the level

---

# 15. Suprasternal notch view

# 16. Right parasternal view (when indicated)

# 2-D, 3D, or M-Mode measurements of the left heart

1. Left ventricular internal dimension and/or volume at end-diastole
2. Left ventricular internal dimension and/or volume at end-systole
3. Left ventricular posterior free wall thickness at end-diastole
4. Ventricular septal thickness at end-diastole
5. LVOT diameter
6. Aortic root dimension or ascending aorta dimension at end-diastole
7. Left atrial volume index at end-systole

# Standard Doppler flow evaluations

1. Four cardiac valves – forward flow spectra for each valve, and any regurgitation, shown in at least two imaging planes with color Doppler
2. Expanded assessment of any valve with suspected > mild disease with and without color flow Doppler
3. Use non-imaging Doppler Transducer to assess stenotic valves, valvular regurgitation or whenever indicated
4. LV Diastolic function assessment using a combination of pulsed-wave Doppler and tissue Doppler methods
5. Tricuspid regurgitation spectrum must always be sought with CW Doppler from multiple views for estimation of systolic right ventricular pressure when tricuspid regurgitation is present
6. Atrial and ventricular septa – color Doppler screening for defects
7. Left ventricular outflow tract velocity and TVI
8. Hepatic and pulmonary vein flow spectra (when indicated)
9. For aortic stenosis, the systolic velocity must be evaluated from multiple transducer positions (e.g., apical, suprasternal, right supraclavicular, and right parasternal). This must include interrogation from multiple views with a dedicated non-imaging continuous wave Doppler transducer (at least one clear envelope must be obtained).

# PoOcoLSUN Study

# Protocol Hunt Study

# Inclusion Criteria

- Appointment type of ‘TTE Shunt’ or ‘PHTN WITH SHUNT’
- Study ordered to rule out intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunt
- Referral of:
- Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) regardless of whether the patient has had a prior shunt study and regardless of whether the result was positive or negative. Also perform PHTN protocol
- Pre-device lead extraction to evaluate for risk of thrombus crossing an intracardiac defect during extraction
- Suspected stroke or cardiac source of embolism where intra-cardiac shunting may be considered*
- Advanced liver disease including cirrhosis (risk of hepatopulmonary syndrome) refer to the liver disease shunt protocol

# Instructions

# VALSALVA – Perform 1st

1. Instruct patient in the performance of the Valsalva maneuver
2. Obtain a 4 chamber view in the following order:
1. Instruct patient in the performance of the Valsalva maneuver
2. Obtain a 10-15 beat clip of the 4 chamber view in the following order:
3. Stop respiration with a held breath at neither inspiration nor expiration
4. Instruct patient to Valsalva and hold strain
5. Inject agitated saline
6. Valsalva strain until the right heart is opacified
7. Release Valsalva and ensure that images acquired include at least 8 beats after Valsalva is released

# REST – Perform 2nd

Obtain a long clip of the 4-chamber view with agitated saline injection

# Caveats and Tips

- Perform Valsalva on all shunt studies (including those to rule out intrapulmonary shunt)
- Sensitivity is enhanced with multiple injections. In stroke patients, perform 2-3 Valsalva saline injections (or more if patient’s age is &lt; 55)
- Use harmonic imaging
- Zoomed view of the atrial septum and pulmonary veins may help determine location of shunt
- Other patient positioning (sitting upright, standing, squat-to-standing) should be done as clinically indicated for diagnoses such as platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome

PFO/ASD: visible in 1-3 beats

Intrapulmonary: visible in 4-8 beats

# PROTOCOL: SHUNT STUDY, CONT.

# EIMS & Epic Data

# Epic

Procedure: select the ‘with contrast’ option

# EIMS

Procedure Components: IV Agitated Saline

# Impressions:

- Patients with right-to-left shunt and known or suspected stroke
1. Add “Patent Foramen Ovale” statement (under shunts, Patent Foramen Ovale)

# Screening TEE Prior to Transcatheter Mitral Edge-to-Edge Repair (TMVr, e.g. MitraClip)

- Specific goals for Screening TEE Prior to Edge-to-Edge Repair (TMVr):
- Assess anatomic suitability for TMVr
- Exclude intra-cardiac thrombus
- Evaluate the atrial septum prior to transseptal puncture
- Assess/confirm the severity of mitral regurgitation (frequently determined on TTE)
- Assess feasibility of peri-procedural imaging (adequate windows for grasping/guidance)
- Required images (in addition to standard TEE):
- 3D full volume or 3D zoom of the mitral valve with and without color Doppler
Should include the entire mitral annulus and a portion of the aortic valve
- CW Doppler of the mitral valve inflow for mean diastolic gradient
- Pulmonary vein spectral Doppler of all pulmonary veins

# Measurements/Impressions to Report (see pages 2-4 for examples)

- Mechanism of mitral regurgitation (primary, secondary, mixed)
- Location of the regurgitant jet(s) (A1-P1, A2-P2, A3-P3)
- Severity of regurgitation (frequently established by TTE)
- The presence and location of mitral annular or leaflet calcification
- Calcification at the grasping site can prohibit clip/device closure and is a contraindication
- Mitral annular calcification, particularly when leaflet infiltration is present, is associated with increased post-procedure mean gradient
- Mitral valve orifice area (preferably by 3D-guided planimetry)
- A baseline mitral valve area <4.0 cm2 is associated with high risk of mitral stenosis post-clip
- Mitral valve mean diastolic gradient
- Baseline mean diastolic gradient ≥4mmHg is associated with elevated gradient post-clip
- Presence/absence of mitral valve clefts or perforations should be noted
- A mitral valve perforation is a contraindication to edge-to-edge repair
- Baseline functional clefts are likely a relative contraindication
- Anterior and posterior mitral leaflet length: ideally 10 mm or more
- Specific measurements for patients with flail leaflet:
- Flail GAP (i.e. the max distance between the anterior and posterior leaflet, ideally <10mm)
- Flail WIDTH (i.e. the width of the flail segment along the affected leaflet, ideally <15mm)
- Statement on the atrial septum and suitability of transseptal puncture

# 3D-Guided Planimetry of Mitral Valve Area

| |Areals)|OAl|Area|3.63 cm²|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Circ|7.84 cm| | | |

# Keys:

- Pause in a diastolic frame at the time of maximal mitral valve opening
- Align one view in a typical long axis view (upper left panel)
- Align one view in a typical commissural view (upper right panel)
- Align the blue lines with the tip of the mitral leaflets for short axis view of the mitral valve (lower left panel)
- Trace the mitral valve orifice area in the short axis view (lower left panel)

# Mitral Leaflet and Annular Calcification

MAC, particularly with mitral leaflet infiltration (arrow) increases the risk of mitral stenosis post-clip. Mitral leaflet calcification at the grasping site may also inhibit clip/device closure.

# Mitral Leaflet Perforation

A 3D TEE left ventricular view of the mitral valve shows perforation of the anterior mitral leaflet by 3D (left, arrow) and confirmed by 3D color Doppler (right, arrow). Leaflet perforation is a contraindication to TMVr.

# HCM MAVACAMTEN

# PROTOCOL ACH

The prescription drug, mavacamten (CAMZYOS), is indicated for the treatment of adults with symptomatic NYHA class II-III obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to improve functional capacity and symptoms. In trials, 4-11% of patients had a transient decrease of LVEF < 50%.

# Inclusion Criteria

- Patient receiving mavacamten treatment for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Typically, echocardiographic monitoring is required at weeks 4, 8, 12, and every 12 weeks thereafter.
- Patients will have an echocardiogram performed prior to drug initiation. While the patient is on mavacamten this protocol should be performed indefinitely (regardless of when their last comprehensive echo was performed).

# EIMS Data

Procedure Components: 2-D Limited, Color Flow Doppler, Doppler Limited, TDI (Tissue Doppler Imaging)

Serial Study: General, HCM

First Finding: Echocardiogram performed per Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy [# month mavacamten] protocol.

Second finding: Last full echo performed…

Performable: (TTE) 2D Limited with Limited Doppler

| |Medial e’|LV Volumes (3D preferred, or 2D)| |
|RV fx|TR velocity (best window)| | |
|Subcostal|IVC| | |

# Caveats and Tips

- *LV fx: it is not necessary to analyze global longitudinal strain, but please acquire apical views with a similar depth, width, & frame rate in the event that speckle tracking strain is performed at a later date.
- **LVOT MIG: assess at rest. If the resting gradient is <50 mmHg proceed with Valsalva, if the Valsalva gradient is <50 mmHg proceed with squat-to-stand. Amyl nitrite is not necessary.
- The following measurements must be documented in measurements or findings: LVEF, LVOT MIG rest, LVOT MIG Valsalva/squat-to-stand (if performed).
- Image enhancement agent is typically not indicated unless unable to determine LVEF without.

# Intra-Procedure TEE during WATCHMAN device deployment

# 1. Pre-implant LAA images:

Exclude: intracardiac thrombus or dense spontaneous echo contrast

significant pericardial effusion

Obtaining LAA measurements to confirm anatomy conducive for Watchman device implantation and to determine the device size

# Left atrial appendage anatomy:

divided into 3 parts.

1. The ostium is typically oval and diameters range from 10-40 mm, is well characterized by 3D imaging and is separated from the left upper pulmonary vein by the posterolateral ridge.
2. The neck of the LAA is the tubular junction between the ostium and lobar portions, neighbors the circumflex and LAD coronaries and the sinus node artery in one third.
3. The lobar region is the largest and most variable portion. Two or more lobes are found in >50%.

# LAA images:

Obtain 2D images of the LAA at decreased depth or zoom to optimize LAA assessment.

Views should be obtained at 0, 45, 90 and 135 degrees

Obtain the maximal measurements of the ostium diameter, width & length of the primary LAA lobe

At 0 degrees, a measurement in the plane from left coronary artery to a point approximately 2 cm from the tip of the postero-lateral ridge is possible. (See diagram below)

At 45, 90, 135 degrees appropriate 2D views such that a measurement in the plane from the top of the MV annulus to a point approximately 2 cm from the tip of the postero-lateral ridge is possible. (See diagrams below)

# Intra-Procedure TEE during WATCHMAN device deployment

Recommended images to be obtained: (measures of the LAA should be performed when LAA size is largest at end ventricular systole)

- 2D 4 chamber, 2 chamber and 3 chamber views optimizing the LV
- Multiple 2D imaging planes of the LA
- Multiple 2D imaging planes of LAA device at decreased depth or zoom mode (at a minimum record views at 0°, 45°, 90° and 135°) – as described above.
- Color Doppler of the LAA at decreased depth or zoom mode, at best angle visualized.
- Reduce the Nyquist limit to optimize color flow (include the full width of the LAA ostium surrounding the borders and tip of LAA).
- Pulsed wave Doppler within the LAA (sampled volume at least 1cm into the LAA);
- 3D of the LAA ostium with diameter and area measures. Off-line measures performed in Q-lab with a similar measurement approach to the LVOT diameter measures.
- 2D Mitral Valve w/w’out color in multiple images planes (include views such as 4ch, 3ch and 2ch)
- CW Doppler through the mitral valve for MS
- 2D and color Doppler of Interatrial Septum at 45°, 90° and 135°. If atrial septal aneurysm is present: measure the atrial septal total excursion and the ASA length
- 2D of agitated saline passage to assess for intraatrial shunt
- 2D imaging from the esophagus and / or stomach to assess for pericardial effusion
- 2D of Ascending Aorta, Aortic Arch and Descending Aorta

Use of echo contrast with low MI imaging (0.1-0.3) should be considered, as appropriate, to differentiate pectinate muscle from thrombus.

# LAA Occluder Device Requirements (5 device sizes: 21, 24, 27, 30 and 33 mm)

- Landing zone should be measured from the inferior part of the LAA ostium at the level of the circumflex coronary artery to a point 1-2 cm distal to the tip of the posterolateral ridge.
- Required landing zone diameters: 17-31 mm.
- Choice of device size: 2-4 mm larger than the largest measured diameter.
- Required depth of main anchoring lobe: needs to be ≥ the maximum LAA ostium size to be able to implant any given size device.

# Intra-Procedure TEE during WATCHMAN device deployment

# 1. Maximum diameter at "shoulders"

# 2. Imaging of the deployed device prior to device release

# Check Device Position:

Perform slow sweep from 0 to 135 degrees to observe device position from all views / angles.

Optimal device position: The plane defined by the maximum diameter of the device should be at or just distal to the plane of the ostium in the majority of views.

If device position is too proximal (significant protrusion of device into the LA), the device should be fully recaptured, removed and re-placed more distally.

If device position is too distal in LAA, the device may be partially recaptured and repositioned more proximally.

CAUTION: A distally placed device may leave secondary LAA lobes patent. Ensure all lobes of the LAA are covered with device. Note that some extra lobes may only be visible at multiplane angles of 90-180 degrees.

# Tips for obtaining LAA images at 0 degrees:

Begin in mid-esophageal view; withdraw the probe until just above the mitral valve; counter clock slightly; flex slightly; adjust the depth of the probe until the LAA is visualized; Adjust the “right-left” wheel to optimize the image.

# Device Size:

Measure deployed device diameter in multiple views (measure greatest device width, see image). Protocol guidelines of 8-20% final device compression apply. A calculated value of device compression which is too low or too high may require device repositioning or device resizing.

“Threaded insert” must be visible when measuring on echo to ensure the device is measured at the widest cross-section in all angles.

# Device Stability:

A device stability check is performed by observing the appendage / device relationship in multiple views. The device and LAA should move in unison. Device movement / displacement in LAA may require device repositioning or resizing.

# Intra-Procedure TEE during WATCHMAN device deployment

# Device Seal

Perform color Doppler assessment prior to the device release by interrogating the entire device /LAA border. Perform a slow sweep from 0° to 180° to fully visualize the placement of the device while performing color Doppler. Include stops at approximately 0°, 45°, 90° and 135° to record clips. Check for residual flow around the device borders.

Significant flow around device edge (>5 mm in diameter) or significant flow into any uncovered secondary lobe(s) will require device repositioning or resizing. Injection of Echo contrast (with the MI index set at (0.1-0.3) may aid in assessing flow around the device. If a leak is visualized, the width of the leak should be measured at the plane of the device at the vena contracta and should exclude any color bleed over the device and/or myocardial structures.

# Imaging of released device (immediately after device release)

- Multiple 2D imaging planes of the LA
- Multiple 2D imaging planes of LAA device at decreased depth or zoom mode to optimize LAA device placement (at a minimum record views at 0°, 45°, 90° and 135°).
- Color Doppler of device at decreased depth or zoom mode, reduce the Nyquist limit to optimize color flow (include the full width of the LAA ostium surrounding the borders and tip of the appendage) (at a minimum record views at 0°, 45°, 90° and 135°).
- Repeat color Doppler interrogation around the device borders to include the entire device/LAA border. Perform a slow sweep from 0° to 180° to fully visualize placement of the device while performing color Doppler.
- Record PW of LAA inside (distal to) the device; optimize scale to show both antegrade and retrograde flow
- Color Doppler of Interatrial Septum at 45°, 90° and 135°

|Question#|Question Text|Answer|Reference|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|I have a female patient with amyloidosis whose last echo was 5 years ago. What imaging and measurements should be obtained?|The patient should receive a full echo workup with left ventricular and right ventricular strain measurements via apical view and right ventricular wall thickness measurement via subcostal view.|Protocol: Amyloidosis|
|2|I have a male patient diagnosed with amyloidosis 6 years ago. He had a color flow Doppler done 3 years ago showcasing mitral regurgitation at Stage 2. His most recent color flow Doppler from 3 months ago showcases that the mitral regurgitation has progressed to Stage 3. Is a comprehensive regurgitation assessment necessary?|No. A comprehensive regurgitation assessment is not necessary since the regurgitation has not progressed by greater than or equal to two stages.|Protocol: Amyloidosis|
|3|A 65 year old male patient is presenting for follow-up for a thoracic aortic aneurysm. The patient's Color Flow Imaging (CFI) demonstrates a regurgitation of 43%. What is the next step to work-up this patient?|This patient should receive a comprehensive aortic regurgitation assessment as their regurgitation fraction puts them at moderate severity aortic regurgitation.|Protocol: Aorta Follow-Up|
|4|In a patient who presents for follow-up imaging for aortic aneurysm, what metric should be measured in the apical view on Doppler imaging?|The metric that should be measured is left ventricular outflow tract velocity-time integral (LVOT-VTI).|Protocol: Aorta Follow-Up|
|5|A 67 year old female patient presents for follow-up for a thoracic aortic aneurysm. What imaging modalities should be done for quantification of the severity of her disease?|The patient should receive a 2D Limited TTE with Color Flow and Doppler.|Protocol: Aorta Follow-Up|
