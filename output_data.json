Use of echo contrast should\n        be considered, as appropriate, to differentiate LAA flow from LUPV pericardial oblique\n        sinus, and to differentiate pectinate muscle from thrombus\n        Absence / presence of residual atrial septal shunt\n        Device position confirmation\n        Absence / presence of thrombus on the WATCHMAN\n        device\n\nImages of the LAA should be optimized at either a decreased\ndepth or in zoom mode.\n\nLAA seal is defined as no or a small amount of visible residual\nblood flow AROUND the margins of the device in a retrograde or\nantegrade fashion, with jet size < 5mm. If there is residual LAA\nblood flow with a jet size > 5mm AROUND the margins of device\nin either a retrograde or antegrade fashion, the device is not\nconsidered 'sealed'.\n\nDevice Seal: Perform color Doppler assessment by interrogating the entire device /LAA border.\nPerform a slow sweep from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 to fully visualize the placement of the device while\nperforming color Doppler. Include stops at approximately 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 to record clips.\nCheck for residual flow around the device borders. Injection of Echo contrast (with low MI\nimaging (0.1 \u2013 0.3)) may aid in assessing flow around the device. If a leak is visualized, the width\nof the leak should be measured at the plane of the device at the vena contracta and should\nexclude any color bleed over the device and/or myocardial structures.\n\nG .Kane 10/12/2015                                                                    Page | 1",

If the resting gradient is <50 mmHg proceed with Valsalva, if the Valsalva gradient is <50 mmHg proceed with squat-to-stand. Amyl nitrite is not necessary\n- The following measurements must be documented in measurements or findings: LVEF, LVOT MIG rest, LVOT MIG Valsalva/squat-to-stand (if performed)\n- Image enhancement agent is typically not indicated unless unable to determine LVEF without\n\nV.

Ensure all lobes of the LAA are covered with device. Note that some extra lobes may only be visible at multiplane angles of 90-180 degrees.\n\nTips for obtaining LAA images at 0 degrees: Begin in mid-esophageal view; withdraw the probe until just above the mitral valve; counter clock slightly; flex slightly; adjust the depth of the probe until the LAA is visualized; Adjust the \"right-left\" wheel to optimize the image.\n\nDevice Size: Measure deployed device diameter in multiple views (measure greatest device width, see image). Protocol guidelines of 8-20% final device compression apply. A calculated value of device compression which is too low or too high may require device repositioning or device resizing.\n\n| Image Description | Instructions |\n|-------------------|--------------|\n| Diagram showing \"Maximum diameter at 'shoulders'\" of a deployed device | \"Threaded insert\" must be visible when measuring on echo to ensure the device is measured at the widest cross-section in all angles. |",
